# machineLearning-tf2-ssd-finetuning
Single Shot Detector (SSD) with Tensorflow

In this repository, there are codes for transfer learning and fine-tuning with custom data set by using TensorFlow. Studies can be tested with different backbones such as mobilenet, resnet etc.

I did not add the images themselves under the data folder because it takes a lot of space. On the other hand, CSV files, and Config files are under the data folder.
